# Anime-vs-UFC

We were tasked with creating an interactive web page/app that utilizes two APIs and creates a unique experience for the user. Our group wanted to move forward using the Youtube and Giphy API and create a fun and lighthearted viewing experience for the user. Our project is called Anime vs UFC and it pairs a anime fight scene against a real life mma fight and the user gets to decide which is more hype.

The page starts out with a Start the Battle button as seen below:

Once the user clicks the button they will see the two contestants in their corners. One button for anime and one for mma:

Those buttons show each Youtube video once clicked:

After the user views the videos they can then pick which fight was most hype and the vote button reveals a gif, one for mma and one for anime. Also local stroage tracks the score of which video wins.
